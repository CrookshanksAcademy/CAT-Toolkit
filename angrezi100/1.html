                    <p>
                        Immigrants' adoption of English as their primary language is one measure of assimilation into
                        the larger United States society. Generally languages define social groups and provide
                        justification for social structures. Hence, a distinctive language sets a cultural group off
                        from the dominant language group. Throughout United States history this pattern has resulted in
                        one consistent, unhappy consequence, discrimination against members of the cultural minority.
                        Language differences provide both a way to rationalize subordination and a ready means for
                        achieving it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally, English has replaced the native language of immigrant groups by the second or
                        third generation. Some characteristics of today's Spanish-speaking population, however, suggest
                        the possibility of a departure from this historical pattern. Many families retain ties in Latin
                        America and move back and forth between their present and former communities. This "revolving
                        door" phenomenon, along with the high probability of additional immigrants from the south, means
                        that large Spanish-speaking communities are likely to exist in the United States for the
                        indefinite future.

                        This expectation underlies the call for national support for bilingual education in
                        Spanish-speaking communities' public schools. Bilingual education can serve different purposes,
                        however. In the 1960s, such programs were established to facilitate the learning of English so
                        as to avoid disadvantaging children in their other subjects because of their limited English.
                        More recently, many advocates have viewed bilingual education as a means to maintain children's
                        native languages and cultures. The issue is important for people with different political
                        agendas, from absorption at one pole to separatism at the other.

                    <p>
                        To date, the evaluations of bilingual education's impact on learning have been inconclusive. The
                        issue of bilingual education has, nevertheless, served to unite the leadership of the nation's
                        Hispanic communities. Grounded in concerns about status that are directly traceable to the
                        United States history of discrimination against Hispanics, the demand for maintenance of the
                        Spanish language in the schools is an assertion of the worth of a people and their culture. If
                        the United States is truly a multicultural nation—that is, if it is one culture reflecting the
                        contributions of many—this demand should be seen as a demand not for separation but for
                        inclusion.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        More direct efforts to force inclusion can be misguided. For example, movements to declare
                        English the official language do not truly advance the cohesion of a multicultural nation. They
                        alienate the twenty million people who do not speak English as their mother tongue. They are
                        unnecessary since the public's business is already conducted largely in English. Further, given
                        the present state of understanding about the effects of bilingual education on learning, it
                        would be unwise to require the universal use of English. Finally, it is for parents and local
                        communities to choose the path they will follow, including how much of their culture they want
                        to maintain for their children.
