                        In recent years the early music movement, which advocates performing a work as it was performed
                        at the time of its composition, has taken on the character of a crusade, particularly as it has
                        moved beyond the sphere of medieval and baroque music and into music from the late eighteenth
                        and early nineteenth centuries by composers such as Mozart and Beethoven. Granted, knowledge
                        about the experience of playing old music on now-obsolete instruments has been of inestimable
                        value to scholars. Nevertheless, the early music approach to performance raises profound and
                        troubling questions.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early music advocates assume that composers write only for the instruments available to them,
                        but evidence suggests that composers of Beethoven’s stature imagined extraordinarily high and
                        low notes as part of their compositions, even when they recognized that such notes could not be
                        played on instruments available at the time. In the score of Beethoven’s first piano concerto,
                        there is a “wrong” note, a high F-natural where the melody obviously calls for a high F-sharp,
                        but pianos did not have this high an F-sharp when Beethoven composed the concerto. Because
                        Beethoven once expressed a desire to revise his early works to exploit the extended range of
                        pianos that became available to him some years later, it seems likely that he would have played
                        the F-sharp if given the opportunity. To use a piano exactly contemporary with the work’s
                        composition would require playing a note that was probably frustrating for Beethoven himself to
                        have had to play.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In addition, early music advocates often inadvertently divorce music and its performance from
                        the life of which they were, and are, a part. The discovery that Haydn’s and Mozart’s symphonies
                        were conducted during their lifetimes by a pianist who played the chords to keep the orchestra
                        together has given rise to early music recordings in which a piano can be heard obtrusively in
                        the foreground, despite evidence indicating that the orchestral piano was virtually inaudible to
                        audiences at eighteenth-century concerts and was dropped as musically unnecessary when a better
                        way to beat time was found. And although in the early nineteenth century the first three
                        movements (sections) of Mozart’s and Beethoven’s symphonies were often played faster, and the
                        last movement slower than today, this difference can readily be explained by the fact that at
                        that time audiences applauded at the end of each movement, rather than withholding applause
                        until the end of the entire work. As a result, musicians were not forced into extra brilliance
                        in the finale in order to generate applause, as they are now. To restore the original tempo of
                        these symphonies represents an irrational denial of the fact that our concepts of musical
                        intensity and excitement have quite simply, changed.

                            Lines 23-24 appears in Para 2, whose purpose is to attack the assumption on the part of early music advocates that composers necessarily write for the instruments that exist at the time. Reread the whole deal, from line 16 on. A piano “exactly contemporary with” Beethoven’s first piano concerto would, we are told at the end, frustrate Beethoven. Sure, it would irritate him to have to play the “bad” F-natural, because the instrument of the time lacked the high F-sharp that existed only in the composer’s imagination and not on the instrument itself. As (D) has it, a piano contemporary with Beethoven’s first piano concerto would be incapable of playing the high F-sharp that the melody calls for. (Note that the actual score was written to accommodate the range of the limited piano—hence the “wrong” note, the high Fnatural that must have driven Ludwig batty.)

As mentioned above, this sentence is pregnant with promise—what are these problems?—and the answer is found in the remaining two Paras.<br><br>

(B) gives the early music movement too much credit—“largely successful” is not a judgment the author makes—and to narrow the rest of the passage discussion merely to “the use of obsolete instruments” leaves out most of what drives para 2 and 3: Beethoven’s imagined piano, the time-beating problem, and the tempo issues.<br><br>

(D), (E) Neither the lack (D), nor the incomplete use (E), of information is ever alluded to as central to the author’s interest in the early music movement.

                            The first piano concerto is introduced at lines 15-16, and as such it acts as the “evidence,” mentioned in the previous sentence, that such eminent composers as Beethoven imagined weird notes that the instruments of the day couldn’t play. In particular, the piece features that high F-sharp that only some hypothetical future piano could hit. (D) expresses not only the point of mentioning the concerto, but the essence of para 2 overall as a problem with the early music movement’s premises.<br><br>

                            (A) has it backwards. Beethoven was forced to include a “wrong” note in his score because the pianos at the time couldn’t accommodate the correct melody. Only later did the range of pianos expand.<br><br>

                            (C) We’re told only that Beethoven thought about revising his earlier works, from which we can’t infer that a revised version of his first piano concerto actually exists. Thus, Beethoven’s first piano concerto is not used here to show that early music advocates stick to original scores despite later revisions, because we don’t even know that there is a revised score for this piece.<br><br>
                            
                            (E) Au contraire again—the piano available at the time Beethoven wrote the first piano concerto frustrated the great composer’s intentions by lacking the high F-sharp called for by the melody.

                            The important word in the stem is “recordings,” which directs us to para 3 in general. You’ll recall that this takes us to the first of two extended examples of what the author sees as a disturbing aspect of the early music movement, its tendency to separate the performance of music from the real life of a bygone day. The recordings in question feature an obtrusive piano thump-thumping the time; that piano is nominally “accurate,” because it did exist in the 1700s, but the fact that 18th-century audiences barely heard it (lines 42-46) means that it is accurate in name only; the recordings’ sound itself is quite different from the 18th-century sound. The sense is that in this respect the movement is crossing itself up, or as (D) puts it, performing music most Unlike the way it sounded at the time of its composition.<bR><br>

(A), (E) Both can be rejected out of hand because of their references to issues introduced later in para 3: tempo and “intensity and excitement,” respectively.<bR><br>

(B) seems to tie lines 3-6 together with para 3, resulting in an extremely weird statement. Where does “betray the influence” come from, and where is the passage ever concerned with influences on the advocates of early music? Strange.<bR><br>

(C) has it exactly backwards. By insisting on a instrument that was present in the 1700s and ending up with a sound that was not, the early music recordings are sacrificing “aesthetic integrity” for the sake of “historical authenticity.”
