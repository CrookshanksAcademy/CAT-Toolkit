                        In recent years the early music movement, which advocates performing a work as it was performed
                        at the time of its composition, has taken on the character of a crusade, particularly as it has
                        moved beyond the sphere of medieval and baroque music and into music from the late eighteenth
                        and early nineteenth centuries by composers such as Mozart and Beethoven. Granted, knowledge
                        about the experience of playing old music on now-obsolete instruments has been of inestimable
                        value to scholars. Nevertheless, the early music approach to performance raises profound and
                        troubling questions.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Early music advocates assume that composers write only for the instruments available to them,
                        but evidence suggests that composers of Beethoven’s stature imagined extraordinarily high and
                        low notes as part of their compositions, even when they recognized that such notes could not be
                        played on instruments available at the time. In the score of Beethoven’s first piano concerto,
                        there is a “wrong” note, a high F-natural where the melody obviously calls for a high F-sharp,
                        but pianos did not have this high an F-sharp when Beethoven composed the concerto. Because
                        Beethoven once expressed a desire to revise his early works to exploit the extended range of
                        pianos that became available to him some years later, it seems likely that he would have played
                        the F-sharp if given the opportunity. To use a piano exactly contemporary with the work’s
                        composition would require playing a note that was probably frustrating for Beethoven himself to
                        have had to play.

                    <p>
                        In addition, early music advocates often inadvertently divorce music and its performance from
                        the life of which they were, and are, a part. The discovery that Haydn’s and Mozart’s symphonies
                        were conducted during their lifetimes by a pianist who played the chords to keep the orchestra
                        together has given rise to early music recordings in which a piano can be heard obtrusively in
                        the foreground, despite evidence indicating that the orchestral piano was virtually inaudible to
                        audiences at eighteenth-century concerts and was dropped as musically unnecessary when a better
                        way to beat time was found. And although in the early nineteenth century the first three
                        movements (sections) of Mozart’s and Beethoven’s symphonies were often played faster, and the
                        last movement slower than today, this difference can readily be explained by the fact that at
                        that time audiences applauded at the end of each movement, rather than withholding applause
                        until the end of the entire work. As a result, musicians were not forced into extra brilliance
                        in the finale in order to generate applause, as they are now. To restore the original tempo of
                        these symphonies represents an irrational denial of the fact that our concepts of musical
                        intensity and excitement have quite simply, changed.

                            The passage discusses how Beethoven's first piano concerto contains a "wrong" note (high
                            F-natural) because contemporary pianos couldn't play the desired high F-sharp. The author
                            uses this example to show that early music advocates' assumption - that composers only wrote
                            for existing instruments - is flawed.

                            Option D correctly identifies that a piano from Beethoven's time couldn't play the high

                            - Early music performances divorce music from its historical context (para 3)<br><br>

                            Option A best captures this by stating the movement raises unresolved questions about its

                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="1">(A) These recordings fail to recognize
                            that the last movements of Haydn’s and Mozart’s symphonies were often played slower in the
                            eighteenth century than they are played today.</div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="2">(B) These recordings betray the influence
                            of baroque musical styles on those early music advocates who have recently turned their
                            attention to the music of Haydn and Mozart.</div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="3">(C) By making audible the sound of an
                            orchestral piano that was inaudible in eighteenth-century performances, these recordings
                            attempt to achieve aesthetic integrity at the expense of historical authenticity.</div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="4">(D) By making audible the sound of an
                            orchestral piano that was inaudible in eighteenth-century performances, these recordings
                            unwittingly create music that is unlike what eighteenth-century audiences heard.</div>

                            The author criticizes early music recordings for prioritizing technical accuracy over
                            authentic listening experiences. The piano example shows how:<br><br>

                            - Recordings feature audible piano even though 18th century audiences barely heard
                            it<br><br>

                            - This creates a sound different from historical performances<br><br>

                            - The movement thus fails in its goal of authentic reproduction<br><br>

                            Option D correctly identifies this paradox - that by being technically accurate (using
                            period instruments), the recordings create inauthentic listening experiences. Other options
                            either discuss unrelated points (A) or reverse the author's argument (C).
