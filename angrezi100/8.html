Economic Struggles of the Tokugawa Shogunate

                        In the eighteenth century, Japan's feudal overlords, from the shogun to the humblest samurai, found themselves under financial stress. In part, this stress can be attributed to the overlords' failure to adjust to a rapidly expanding economy, but the stress was also due to factors beyond their control.





                    </p>
                    <p>




                        The concentration of the samurai in castle towns had acted as a stimulus to trade. Commercial efficiency, in turn, had put temptations in the way of buyers. Since most samurai had been reduced to idleness by years of peace—encouraged to engage in scholarship, martial exercises, or administrative tasks that took little time—it is not surprising that their tastes and habits grew expensive.

<P>





    Overlords' income, despite the increase in rice production among their tenant farmers, failed to keep pace with their expenses. Although shortfalls in income resulted almost as much from laxity among tax collectors (the nearly inevitable outcome of hereditary officeholding) as from higher standards of living, a misfortune like a fire or flood—bringing an increase in expenses or a drop in revenue—could put a domain in debt to the city rice brokers who handled its finances. Once in debt, neither the individual samurai nor the shogun himself found it easy to recover.






                    </p>

                    <p>





It was difficult for individual samurai overlords to increase their income because the amount of rice that farmers could be made to pay in taxes was not unlimited. Since the income of Japan's central government consisted in part of taxes collected by the shogun from his huge domain, the government too was constrained. Therefore, the Tokugawa shoguns began to look to other sources for revenue.




                    </p>

                    <p>




Cash profits from government-owned mines were already on the decline because the most easily worked deposits of silver and gold had been exhausted, although debasement of the coinage had compensated for the loss. Opening up new farmland was a possibility, but most suitable land had already been exploited, and further reclamation was technically unfeasible. Direct taxation of the samurai themselves would be politically dangerous. This left the shoguns with only commerce as a potential source of government income.





                    </p>

                    <p>



Most of the country's wealth, or so it seemed, was finding its way into the hands of city merchants. It appeared reasonable that they should contribute part of that revenue to ease the shogun's burden of financing the state. A means of obtaining such revenue was soon found by levying forced loans, known as goyo-kin. Although these were not taxes in the strict sense—since they were irregular in timing and arbitrary in amount—they were high in yield.




                    </p>

                    <p>




Unfortunately, they pushed up prices. Thus, regrettably, the Tokugawa shoguns' search for government solvency made it increasingly difficult for individual Japanese who lived on fixed stipends to make ends meet.

1. Which of the following financial situations is most analogous to the financial situation in which Japan’s Tokugawa shoguns found themselves in the eighteenth century?





                    </div>
                    <div class="options">
                        <div class="option" data-question="1" data-option="1">



(A) A small business borrows heavily to invest in new equipment, but is able to pay off its debt early when it is awarded a lucrative government contract.
                        


</div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="1" data-option="2">


(B) Fire destroys a small business, but insurance covers the cost of rebuilding.



                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="1" data-option="3">



(C) A small business is turned down for a loan at a local bank because the owners have no credit history.




                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="1" data-option="4">



(D) A small business has to struggle to meet operating expenses when its profits decrease.



                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation" id="explanation-1">
                        <div class="explanation-header">

                        </div>
                        <div class="explanation-content">




                            Option D is correct. Just like the Tokugawa shoguns, who struggled to meet operating expenses despite various efforts, a small business facing decreased profits must also find ways to survive with limited resources.




                        </div>
                        
                    </div>

                <div id="question-2" class="question-container">
                    <div class="question">




2. According to the passage, the major reason for the financial problems experienced by Japan’s feudal overlords in the eighteenth century was that

                    <div class="options">
                        <div class="option" data-question="2" data-option="1">



(A) spending had outdistanced income

                        <div class="option" data-question="2" data-option="2">


(B) trade had fallen off




                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="2" data-option="3">



(C) profits from mining had declined




                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="2" data-option="4">



(D) the coinage had been sharply debased



                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation" id="explanation-2">

                        <div class="explanation-content">
                            




Option A is correct. The passage highlights that the overlords' expenses rose due to lavish habits and administrative inefficiencies, while income failed to keep pace—indicating overspending was the central issue.



                        </div>
                        
                    </div>
                </div>
            
                <div id="question-3" class="question-container">
                    <div class="question">



3. The passage suggests that, in eighteenth-century Japan, the office of tax collector




                    </div>
                    <div class="options">
                        <div class="option" data-question="3" data-option="1">



(A) was a source of personal profit to the officeholder




                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="3" data-option="2">



(B) was regarded with derision by many Japanese





                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="3" data-option="3">



(C) remained within families




                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="3" data-option="4">



(D) existed only in castle-towns




                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation" id="explanation-3">

                        <div class="explanation-content">
                           



 Option C is correct. The passage notes that laxity among tax collectors was "the nearly inevitable outcome of hereditary officeholding," implying tax collector roles were passed down in families.




                        </div>
                        
                    </div>

                <div id="question-4" class="question-container">
                    <div class="question">



4. The passage implies that which of the following was the primary reason why the Tokugawa shoguns turned to city merchants for help in financing the state?




                    </div>
                    <div class="options">
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="1">



(A) A series of costly wars had depleted the national treasury.



                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="2">



(B) Most of the country's wealth appeared to be in city merchants' hands.



                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="3">


(C) Japan had suffered a series of economic reversals due to natural disasters such as floods.



                        </div>
                        <div class="option" data-question="4" data-option="4">


(D) The merchants were already heavily indebted to the shoguns.



                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="explanation" id="explanation-4">

                        <div class="explanation-content">
                          



  Option B is correct. The passage states that most of the country's wealth seemed to be in the hands of merchants, prompting the shogunate to levy forced loans from them to finance the state.
