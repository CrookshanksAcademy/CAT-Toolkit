    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "article": "Colonial historian David Allen's intensive study of five communities in seventeenth-century Massachusetts is a model of meticulous scholarship on the detailed microcosmic level, and is convincing up to a point. Allen suggests that much more coherence and direct continuity existed between English and colonial agricultural practices and administrative organization than other historians have suggested. However, he overstates his case with the declaration that he has proved \"the remarkable extent to which diversity in New England local institutions was directly imitative of regional differences in the mother country.\"\n\nSuch an assertion ignores critical differences between seventeenthâ€”century England and New England. First, England was overcrowded and land-hungry; New England was sparsely populated and labor-hungry. Second, England suffered the normal European rate of mortality; New England, especially in the first generation of English colonists, was virtually free from infectious diseases. Third, England had an all-embracing state church; in New England membership in a church was restricted to the elect. Fourth, a high proportion of English villagers lived under paternalistic resident squires; no such class existed in New England. By narrowing his focus to village institutions and ignoring these critical differences, which studies by Greven, Demos, and Lockridge have shown to be so important, Allen has created a somewhat distorted picture of reality.",

            "text": "The passage suggests that Professor Clive Holmes would most likely agree with which of the following statements?",
            "options": [
                "An understanding of seventeenth-century English local institutions requires a consideration of national issues.",
                "The \"country community\" school of seventeenth- century English history distorts historical evidence in order to establish continuity between old and new institutions.",
                "Most historians distort reality by focusing on national concerns to the exclusion of local concerns.",
                "National issues are best understood from the perspective of those at the local level."
            ],
            "correctAnswer": 1,
            "explanation": "Option A is correct. The passage mentions that Professor Clive Holmes critiques the \"country community\" school for removing all national issues from the history of seventeenth-century England. This implies he believes national issues must be considered alongside local ones for a complete understanding."

            "correctAnswer": 4,
            "explanation": "Option D is correct. The author criticizes Allen's \"discovery\" about Puritan clergy as lacking historical context, calling it an unexplained fact that does not contribute to broader historical understanding."
