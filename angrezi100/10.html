                    <p>
                        As is well known and has often been described, the machine industry of recent times took its
                        rise by a gradual emergence out of handicraft in England in the eighteenth century. Since then
                        the mechanical industry has progressively been getting the upper hand in all the civilized
                        nations, in much the same degree in which these nations have come to be counted as civilized.
                        This mechanical industry now stands dominant at the apex of the industrial system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The state of the industrial arts, as it runs on the lines of the mechanical industry, is a
                        technology of physics and chemistry. That is to say, it is governed by the same logic as the
                        scientific laboratories. The procedure, the principles, habits of thought, preconceptions, units
                        of measurement and of valuation, are the same in both cases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The technology of physics and chemistry is not derived from established law and custom, and it
                        goes on its way with as nearly complete a disregard of the spiritual truths of law and custom as
                        the circumstances will permit. The realities with which this technology is occupied are of
                        another order of actuality, lying altogether within the three dimensions that contain the
                        material universe, and running altogether on the logic of material fact. In effect it is the
                        logic of inanimate facts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mechanical industry makes use of the same range of facts handled in the same impersonal way
                        and directed to the same manner of objective results. In both cases alike it is of the first
                        importance to eliminate the "personal equation," to let the work go forward and let the forces
                        at work take effect quite objectively, without hindrance or deflection for any personal end,
                        interest, or gain. It is the technician's place in industry, as it is the scientist's place in
                        the laboratory, to serve as an intellectual embodiment of the forces at work, isolate the forces
                        engaged from all extraneous disturbances, and let them take full effect along the lines of
                        designed work. The technician is an active or creative factor in the case only in the sense that
                        he is the keeper of the logic which governs the forces at work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These forces that so are brought to bear in mechanical industry are of an objective, impersonal,
                        unconventional nature, of course. They are of the nature of opaque fact. Pecuniary gain is not
                        one of these impersonal facts. Any consideration of pecuniary gain that may be injected into the
                        technician's working plans will come into the case as an intrusive and alien factor, whose sole
                        effect is to deflect, retard, derange and curtail the work in hand. At the same time
                        considerations of pecuniary gain are the only agency brought into the case by the businessmen,
                        and the only ground on which they exercise a control of production.
                    </p>
